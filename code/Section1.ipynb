    "HDB flats are often labelled as the government's first gift to Singaporeans, leading majority of the population living in them. While many Singaporeans acquire their homes through the Build-to-Order (BTO) scheme, a considerable number of people choose to purchase flats on the resale market due to various reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the years, it has become a known fact that purchasing a home is often the largest financial decision most people will make, it is essential to ensure that the price paid reflects the property's true value. Overpaying for a flat could lead to significant financial setbacks, sometimes amounting to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the right price for a HDB resale flat is complicated, as there are many factors that influence housing prices, giving buyers a hard time in determining the best home for their future. This project aims to tackle the challenge of accurately estimating resale values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Question:\n",
    "**<center>How can we effectively forecast the resale price of an HDB flat using relevant data?</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "This initiative seeks to empower buyers by providing clarity on the factors that drive resale prices, helping them make sound financial decisions when selecting resale flats. To achieve this, a linear regression model will be utilized, with resale price as the outcome variable and key housing-related factors as predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance will be evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), where a smaller RMSE reflects better predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projectâ€™s primary beneficiaries are home buyers seeking guidance on fair pricing. Additionally, housing agents, who play a critical role in advising buyers, will also find the insights valuable."
